WARNING: [Simtcl 6-142] log_wave skipped an HDL object or scope because of this problem: WARNING: Simulation object /project_tb/RAM was not traceable in the design for the following reason:
The number of elements in the requested object is 524288, which exceeds the maximum traceable size of 65536 elements.
The maximum can be changed with "set_property trace_limit <number of elements> [current_sim]" Tcl command.
